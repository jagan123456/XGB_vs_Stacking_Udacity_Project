## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project



This project is uses the UCI US census data from 1994/95 (see the project report for the link and census-income.csv for the dataset used). The target feature is a binary prediction of whether each person earns more or less than $50k.

The Project_Report.docx outlines the entire project and should be read simultaneously whilst following the Capstone_Project.ipynb notebook.

The purpose of the project is to compare a benchmark XGBoost model against a stacking classifier to see which produces a better AUC. The main objective is to better understand stacking classifiers and how they work/compare to a single machine learning modelling technique as opposed to focussing on optimizing the AUC. This is outlined further in the project report.
